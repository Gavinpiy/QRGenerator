# QRGenerator
Python QR Code Generator

Project Description:

The Python QR Code Generator is a web application built using Flask that allows users to generate QR codes for any link they input. This project was initiated as a learning endeavor to delve deeper into Python programming and gain practical experience in developing and deploying web applications. By utilizing Flask, a lightweight web framework, this project aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for generating QR codes from user-provided URLs.

Motivation:

The primary motivation behind this project was to expand knowledge and proficiency in Python programming by tackling a practical problem. Developing a QR code generator not only provided an opportunity to explore Python's capabilities but also served as a stepping stone into web development with frameworks like Flask. Additionally, the desire to understand the process of deploying web applications fueled the creation of this project.

Why This Project:

Creating a QR code generator using Python and Flask presented a hands-on approach to learning various aspects of web development, including handling HTTP requests, routing, templating, and deploying applications. By focusing on a specific use case—generating QR codes from URLs—the project provided a clear objective while allowing for experimentation and exploration of different Python libraries and frameworks.

Problem Solving:

The Python QR Code Generator addresses the need for a simple and accessible tool to create QR codes from URLs. By leveraging the capabilities of Flask, the application offers a straightforward interface for users to input their desired links and instantly generate corresponding QR codes. This solution streamlines the process of generating QR codes, eliminating the need for specialized software or complex workflows.

What We Learned:

Throughout the development of this project, valuable insights were gained into Python programming, web development fundamentals, and deployment processes. By working with Flask, we learned how to structure web applications, handle user input, and integrate external libraries for generating QR codes. I am currently battling with deploying the application as it is completely new to me!
